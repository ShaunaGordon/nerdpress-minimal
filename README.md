# Nerdpress Minimal, an Octopress theme

This is the first, and most minimal, in what I plan to be a series of similar themes. The idea will be to make this theme a clean, minimal one, with minimal graphics and effects. It could be a good base theme to run with, or used on its own.

## Why "Nerdpress"?

It's simple, really -- I fail at coming up with names, and "Nerdpress" always comes to my mind whenever I think about Octopress. It comes from my internal joke that Octopress is "WordPress for nerds", or "Nerdpress".

## Why This Theme?

Octopress is popular, but most people stick with Octopress Classic. That's fine and dandy -- it's really a well-done theme -- but, everyone uses it. I prefer to be different, and hopefully provide a little bit of variety to the Octopress ecosystem. These themes also help me practice my design skills (so maybe one day, I can actually say I have something in the way of skills).

## Features?

The theme uses Octopress Classic's source, so the feature set is still pretty much the same, and, of course, you can still add plugins. Where it's minimal is in its design. Nothing is added unless it's needed, so things like JavaScript libraries are only added once they are required (and in the case of polyfills, are only activated in the browsers that need them). You also won't see much in the way of flashy CSS, or things like @font-face (the nice fonts come from a font stack that looks for a font that is already installed on the person's computer).

## Changes

While Nerdpress uses nearly the same source (the extra libraries that make Classic "fancier" have been pulled out, the head consists of nothing external except for HTML5Shiv, activated with conditional comments), the CSS is rewritten from the ground up, so that I could take a more "back to basics" approach to responsive design and didn't have to fight with Classic's CSS.

**This is currently a work in progress.** Seriously, I just started on this project
